# Recovery Guide

## Feature Registry
**Location:** components/config/features.js
**Single source of truth** for all features, routes, and navigation.

**NEVER inline the registry into pages.** If imports break, fix the alias/path.

**Access:**
\`\`\`javascript
import { FEATURES, FEATURE_AREAS } from '@/components/config/features';
\`\`\`

## Vault Access
**Route:** /vault
**Purpose:** Directory of all 40+ platform features

Imports from centralized registry and displays with search/filter.

## Content Protection Policy
**Storage:** ContentProtectionPolicy entity (school_id scoped)

**Default Policy:**
- protect_content: true
- require_payment_for_materials: true
- allow_previews: true
- max_preview_seconds: 90
- max_preview_chars: 1500
- watermark_enabled: true
- copy_mode: "ADDON"
- download_mode: "ADDON"

**Admin:** School Admin → Protection tab

## Multi-Tenant Safety
**Active School:** localStorage.getItem('active_school_id')
**Session:** Use useSession() hook
**Scoped Queries:** components/api/scoped.js helpers

## Terminology
**Config:** School Admin → Terms tab
**Presets:** Breslov, Yeshiva, Generic
**Access:** useTerminology(school) hook

## Diagnostics
**Route:** /integrity (admin-only, vault-only)

## Common Issues

### Import Errors
✅ DO: Fix Vite alias or path
❌ DON'T: Inline registry into pages

### Content Leakage
Check these pages enforce useLessonAccess:
- LessonViewerPremium
- Reader
- Downloads

### Cross-School Leaks
Verify queries use scoped helpers with activeSchoolId
