# Release Trains & Future Builds (Continuous Improvement Plan)
Prepared: January 01, 2026 (Asia/Jerusalem)

## Build channels
- **Stable**: tagged releases only (must pass QA + integrity export)
- **Beta** (optional): release candidates for risky UI/onboarding changes
- **Nightly** (optional): build artifact on every merge to main

## Versioning (practical)
- `v9.0.0` milestone stable
- `v9.0.x` patches
- `v9.1.0` feature release
- `v10.0.0` major planned change (rare)

## Definition of a “build”
A build includes:
- code
- CHANGELOG entry
- RECOVERY updates (if needed)
- integrity report sample (stable)
- known issues list updated

## Future build epics (suggested)
- v9.1: Onboarding & tenant excellence
- v9.2: Student learning WOW
- v9.3: Teacher power tools
- v9.4: Storefront conversion & trust
- v9.5: Observability + QA + perf budgets
