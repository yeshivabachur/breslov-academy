*** IMPORTANT ***
Do NOT overwrite the canonical root .gitlab-ci.yml.
Apply one of the patches below depending on your current file.

--- A) If you have NO 'include:' block yet, add near the top:

include:
  - local: .gitlab/ci/kit.rules.yml
  - local: .gitlab/ci/kit.ci-node-windows.yml
  - local: .gitlab/ci/kit.security-basics.yml
  # Optional (requires Linux runner):
  # - local: .gitlab/ci/kit.releases.yml

--- B) If you ALREADY have an 'include:' list, append these entries to it.
