# V11 Master Feature Index (Breslov University)

Status: Draft, canon-targeted for v11
Last updated: 2026-01-11

This index enforces "no feature loss" by assigning a permanent ID to every feature or idea.
Do not delete rows. Mark status, priority, and owners instead.

ID scheme:
- V11-CORE-###, V11-TEACH-###, V11-ADMIN-###, V11-MKT-###, V11-LABS-###, V11-SYS-### for registry features
- V11-PLAT-### for platform and integration features

Priority:
- P0 = launch gate, must have owner + acceptance tests
- P1 = post-launch, planned
- P2 = future

Status:
- planned, building, verified, deferred
